We attempted to demonstrate this system with two trials of an online between-groups, two-bytwo study, measuring the effects of this mixed-initiative system on user interactions and system usability. However, due to ﬂaws in the interface design and the expectations that we put on users, we were unable to show that the adaptive system had an impact on user interactions or system usability. In this paper, we discuss the unexpected ﬁndings that we found from our “failed” experiments and examine how we can learn from our failures to improve further research.","tags":[],"title":"Expectation Versus Reality: The Failed Evaluation of a Mixed-Initiative Visualization System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ha","S.","Costales","R.","Bancilhon","M.","Puri","S.","Ottley","A."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1600669419,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600669419,"objectID":"82ce3425bad882fad10da0d5a6f90902","permalink":"/publication/uncovering_user_interest_during_data_exploration_via_unsupervised_clustering/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T01:23:39-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/uncovering_user_interest_during_data_exploration_via_unsupervised_clustering/","section":"publication","summary":"The emergence and increasing usage of large and dense datasets pose a challenge to both the user and visualization designers. As the visualization becomes more congested with information, it grows difficult for the user to make observations due to information overload. One solution that has garnered immense interest in recent years is to create intelligent systems that learn the user's interest and aid in data exploration. However, inferring high-level interest is still an open challenge. In this paper, we present a technique for uncovering potential data points of interest based on user interactions by learning natural groups in a given dataset via unsupervised clustering. We validate our technique's ability to discover user interest with two crowd-sourced interaction datasets. We discuss and demonstrate how to incorporate our approach into an adaptive visual system that supports users during data exploration.","tags":[],"title":"Uncovering User Interest during Data Exploration via Unsupervised Clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wayllace","C.","Ha","S.","Han","Y.","Hu","J.","Monadjemi","S.","Yeoh","W.","Ottley","A."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585894872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585894872,"objectID":"998aa976d54248281cb12b185dbb15ab","permalink":"/publication/dragon-v_detection_and_recognition_of_airplane_goals_with_navigational_visualization/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T01:21:12-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dragon-v_detection_and_recognition_of_airplane_goals_with_navigational_visualization/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce Detection and Recognition of Airplane GOals with Navigational Visualization (DRAGON-V), a visualization system that uses probabilistic goal recognition to infer and display the most probable airport runway that a pilot is approaching. DRAGON-V is especially useful in cases of miscommunication, low visibility, or lack of airport familiarity which may result in a pilot deviating from the assigned taxiing route. The visualization system conveys relevant information, and updates according to the airplane’s current geolocation. DRAGON-V aims to assist air trafﬁc controllers in reducing incidents of runway incursions at airports.","tags":[],"title":"DRAGON V: Detection and Recognition of Airplane Goals with Navigational Visualization","type":"publication"}]
